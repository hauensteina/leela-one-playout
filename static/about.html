    So I did a little web app to test my keras scoring model.
    While I was at it, I hooked up leela set to one playout, for
    no good reason at all. One playout means it doesn't really
    go through variations, just play what feels good.
    Sort of like a pro after a bottle of whiskey:
    They can't think, but somehow they win anyway.

    Give it a spin. If you can win without help, drop me a message.
    If you're in the bay area, I might buy you dinner.
