    So I did a little web app to test my keras scoring model.
    While I was at it, I hooked up leela set to one playout, for
    no good reason at all. One playout means it doesn't really
    go through variations, just play what feels good.
    Sort of like a pro after a bottle of whiskey:
    They can't think, but somehow they win anyway.

    Give it a spin. If you can win without help, drop me a message.
    If you're in the bay area, I might buy you dinner.

    Notes:
    ---------

    Leela always plays the strongest move.
    Kroker sometimes plays moves that are almost the strongest.
    You can take handicap using the pass button.
    Komi is always 7.5, even in handicap games.
