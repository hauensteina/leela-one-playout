    This is Leela Zero on 256 playouts, with some randomness
    in the first 25 moves. It is definitely pro strength, but
    also amusing, because it plays 3-4 or 3-3 on occasion.

    If this gets you down, play Kroker.
    Let Leela help you in a pinch.

    Notes:
    ---------

    Leela reads
    and always plays the strongest move
    after move 25.

    Kroker does not read
    and sometimes plays moves that are debatable.

    You can take handicap using the pass button.

    Komi is always 7.5, even in handicap games.
